 * ---[Description]--------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      Implements Dijkstra's algorithm to calculate the shortest
 *      path from a Player's location to their respective goal row.
 *
 * ---[Bugs]---------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      (FIXED) April 29 - last row is not calculated correctly
 *      (FIXED) April 30 - redundant locations are being calculated
 *          for players 1, 2, and 3. a direction bias is needed
 *      (FIXED) April 30 - ensure appropriate wall checking for players
 *          1, 2, and 3. currently incorrect due to direction bias
 *      (FIXED) May 2 - Player 0 is not detecting walls
 *      April 30 - a Vertex graph is unnecessary, but helps
 *          visualize the algorithm. remove this functionality
 *          once the integrity of the algorithm has been verified
 *
 * ---[Methods]------------------------------------------------------
 *
 *      Graph(int)                   --> constructs the graph 
 *      buildPath(GameBoard, Player) --> builds path for player
 *      printGraph()                 --> prints vis. rep. of graph
 *      printPath(Vertex)            --> prints the path
